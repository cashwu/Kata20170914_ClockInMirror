Clock in Mirror

Peter can see a clock in the mirror from the place he sits in the office. When he saw the clock shows 12:22

He knows that the time is 11:38

in the same manner:

05:25 --> 06:35

01:50 --> 10:10

11:58 --> 12:02

12:01 --> 11:59

Please complete the method which is provided with mirror time as string, and return the real time as string.

The return time value should always be between 1<= time < 13. This is the convenient way that human read the clock.

So there is no 00:20, instead it is 12:20.

There is no 13:20, instead it is 01:20.
